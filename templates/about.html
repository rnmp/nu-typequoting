        <p class="lead">Typequoting brings storytelling and typography together in a particular way.</p>
        <p>Every visitor of the site is asked to create a story inspired by five random elements in less than a minute. These elements are directly related to the shape and resemblance of letterforms. The point of the game is to make connections between elements and end up with a unique story.</p>
        <p>This website actually started as a poster project for <a href="http://spire-id.com/" target="_blank">William Bevington's</a> Typography class on Parsons School of Design, where classmates were asked to write stories based on compositions inspired by typographic elements.</p>
        <p>All the stories are publicly available on the <a href="/submissions">submissions page.</a> If you would like to add more images to the collection featured above, please send an email to <a href="rolando@bandd.co">rolando@bandd.co</a>.</p>
